- [x] reread paper [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] create article
- [ ] Research
	- [ ] NNs/CNNs
		- [ ] normalization
			- [ ] initial
			- [ ] after layer/batch
		- [x] convolutional layer
			- [ ] pooling		
			- [x] kernel
			- [x] stride
			- [x] padding
		- [ ] why do we use transpose layers in generator?
- [x] create generator/discriminator NNs in project
	- [x] don't forget to create separate branch
	- [x] create regular DCNN
		- [x] use MNIST
	- [x] bootstrap everything
		- [x] create discriminator class
		- [x] create generator class
	- [x] create training procedure
	- [x] plug MNIST into GAN
- [ ] Try out other datasets

- [x] Adopt loss-functions from [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] Reference [Github AnoGAN](https://github.com/seungjunlee96/AnoGAN-pytorch)
	- [x] Inference
- [x] ***Finalize Programming (AnoGAN)
	- [x] Log anomaly score for input-image
	- [x] Add ROC-Score
		- [x] TPR (Specificity) vs. FPR (Sensitivity)
		- [x] log more data for that
			- [x] take care that you have a realistic normal/outlier ratio
	- [x] title of third column is wrong
	- [x] add another column with subtraction
		- [x] don't forget abs!
- [ ] Update thesis outline
- [ ] Paper review
	- [ ] find 10 appropriate paper
	- [ ] find paper cluster
	- [ ] cluster found paper
	- [ ] try to generate a pipe
	- [ ] image matching
