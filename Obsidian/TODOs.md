- [x] reread paper [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] create article
- [ ] research
	- [ ] NNs/CNNs
		- [ ] normalization
			- [ ] initial
			- [ ] after layer/batch
		- [x] convolutional layer
			- [ ] pooling		
			- [x] kernel
			- [x] stride
			- [x] padding
		- [ ] why do we use transpose layers in generator?
- [x] create generator/discriminator NNs in project
	- [x] don't forget to create separate branch
	- [x] create regular DCNN
		- [x] use MNIST
	- [x] bootstrap everything
		- [x] create discriminator class
		- [x] create generator class
	- [x] create training procedure
	- [x] plug MNIST into GAN
- [ ] Try out other datasets
	- [ ] [MVTec](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/)
	- [ ] [CIVAR19](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [x] Adopt loss-functions from [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] Reference [Github AnoGAN](https://github.com/seungjunlee96/AnoGAN-pytorch)
	- [x] Inference
- [ ] Finalize Programming
	- [ ] Add ROC-Score
		- [ ] TPR vs. FPR
		- [ ] log more data for that
		- [ ] 
			- [ ] take care that you have a realistic normal/outlier ratio
	- [ ] title of third column is wrong
	- [ ] add another column with subtraction
		- [ ] don't forget abs!
- [x] Write thesis outline
- [ ] Paper review
	- [ ] find 10 appropriate paper
	- [ ] find paper cluster
	- [ ] cluster found paper
	- [ ] try to generate a pipe
	- [ ] image matching
