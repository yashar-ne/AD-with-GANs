		- [ ] why do we use transpose layers in generator?
- [x] create generator/discriminator NNs in project
	- [x] don't forget to create separate branch
	- [x] create regular DCNN
		- [x] use MNIST
	- [x] bootstrap everything
		- [x] create discriminator class
		- [x] create generator class
	- [x] create training procedure
	- [x] plug MNIST into GAN
- [ ] Try out other datasets

	- [ ] [CIVAR19](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [x] Adopt loss-functions from [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] Reference [Github AnoGAN](https://github.com/seungjunlee96/AnoGAN-pytorch)
	- [x] Inference
- [x] ***Finalize Programming (AnoGAN)
	- [x] Log anomaly score for input-image
	- [x] Add ROC-Score
		- [x] TPR (Specificity) vs. FPR (Sensitivity)
		- [x] log more data for that
			- [x] take care that you have a realistic normal/outlier ratio
	- [x] title of third column is wrong
	- [x] add another column with subtraction
		- [x] don't forget abs!
- [ ] Update thesis outline

	- [ ] Implement feature discovery method from paper
		- [ ] Train model and obtain A-Matrix
	- [ ] Create tiny App that visualizes X samples and lets supervisor label/rate anomalous samples
	- [ ] Discover axes that are related to found anomalies
	- [ ] Create new (L2) distance metric where found axes are weighted higher
	- [ ] Based on new Distance metric, create method to find closes neighbor with respect to fond axes
	- [ ] Generate anomaly-score, based on this neighbor and found axes
		- [ ] Use f-AnoGAN for that
