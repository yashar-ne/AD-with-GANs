- [x] reread paper [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] create article
- [ ] research
	- [ ] NNs/CNNs
		- [ ] normalization
			- [ ] initial
			- [ ] after layer/batch
		- [x] convolutional layer

		- [ ] why do we use transpose layers in generator?
- [ ] create generator/discriminator NNs in project
	- [x] don't forget to create separate branch
	- [x] create regular DCNN
		- [x] use MNIST
	- [x] bootstrap everything
		- [x] create discriminator class
		- [x] create generator class
	- [x] create training procedure
	- [x] plug MNIST into GAN
	- [ ] try out other datasets
