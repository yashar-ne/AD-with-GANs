- [x] reread paper [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [x] create article
- [ ] research
	- [ ] NNs/CNNs
		- [ ] normalization
			- [ ] initial
			- [ ] after layer
		- [ ] convolutional layer
			- [ ] pooling		
			- [ ] kernel
			- [ ] stride
			- [ ] padding
		- [ ] why do we user transpose layers in generator?
- [ ] create generator/discriminator NNs in project
	- [x] donÂ´t forget to create separate branch
	- [x] create regular DCNN
		- [x] use MNIST
	- [ ] bootstrap everything
		- [x] create discriminator class
		- [ ] create generator class
	- [ ] create training procedure
	- [ ] plug fashion MNIST into GAN
	- [ ] try out other datasets
		- [ ] [MVTec](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/)
		- [ ] [CIVAR19](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [ ] Adopt loss-functions from [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Guide Marker Discovery]]
	- [ ] Reference [Github AnoGAN](https://github.com/seungjunlee96/AnoGAN-pytorch)
- [ ] Write thesis outline
