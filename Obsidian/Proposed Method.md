- Create new dataset with MNIST numbers (different classes) and add artificial looking numbers as an additional class. Keep also masked images from MNIST
- AnoGAN/f-AnoGAN  identifies outlier
- New model finds new dimension-axes for latent space
	- visualize samples from found axes
		- can they be ranked
	- show positives and and let supervisor label false positives
- infer weights for axes
- with modified distance metric find closest neighbor in inlier space (AnoGan space)
- compare found neighbor with respect to found axes
